My Emacs configuration, cobbled together from across the internet.

It is written in literate programming style, using Org mode.  It works with the latest GNU Emacs for Mac OS X nightlies; it has not been tested on other versions, and will probably break.

There are submodules in the tree now, so if you are cloning, you'll need to run

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

for it to work properly.
