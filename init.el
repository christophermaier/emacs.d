;; I'm experimenting with keeping my Emacs configuration in literate Org files.
;; This bootstraps the whole thing.

;; NOTE: The name of the Org files is important!  When a file gets tangled,
;; it gets the same base name as the Org file.  Thus, tangling Emacs Lisp from
;; a file `init.org` would generate `init.el`, obliterating this file in the
;; process!
